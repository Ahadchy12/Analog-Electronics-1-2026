# Assignment 1.1 – Theory Questions

## Question 8  
**Define electricity and electronics. Highlight the key differences between the two terms.**

Electricity is the branch of engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electrical power. It mainly focuses on high-power systems such as power plants, transmission lines, motors, and household electrical wiring.

Electronics is the branch of engineering that deals with the flow and control of electrons in electronic components such as diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. It mainly focuses on low-power systems used for signal processing, communication, and control.

**Key Differences:**
- Electricity mainly deals with power generation and usage.
- Electronics mainly deals with signal control and processing.
- Electrical systems usually operate at high voltage and current.
- Electronic systems usually operate at low voltage and current.
